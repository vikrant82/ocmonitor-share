### Time-Based Reporting

#### `ocmonitor daily|weekly|monthly <path> [--breakdown]`

Time-based usage breakdown with optional per-model cost analysis.

```bash
# Daily breakdown
ocmonitor daily ~/.local/share/opencode/storage/message

# Weekly breakdown with per-model breakdown
ocmonitor weekly ~/.local/share/opencode/storage/message --breakdown

# Monthly breakdown
ocmonitor monthly ~/.local/share/opencode/storage/message

# Weekly with custom start day
ocmonitor weekly ~/.local/share/opencode/storage/message --start-day friday --breakdown
```

**`--breakdown` Flag:** Shows token consumption and cost per model within each time period (daily/weekly/monthly), making it easy to see which models are consuming resources.

Supported days: `monday`, `tuesday`, `wednesday`, `thursday`, `friday`, `saturday`, `sunday`

### Live Monitoring Commands

#### `ocmonitor live <path>`

Real-time monitoring dashboard that updates automatically.

```bash
# Start live monitoring (updates every 5 seconds)
ocmonitor live ~/.local/share/opencode/storage/message

# Custom refresh interval (in seconds)
ocmonitor live ~/.local/share/opencode/storage/message --refresh 10
```

**Features:**
- 🔄 Auto-refreshing display with professional UI design
- 📊 Real-time cost tracking with progress indicators
- ⏱️ Live session duration with 5-hour progress bar
- 📈 Token usage updates and context window monitoring
- 🚦 Color-coded status indicators and time alerts
- 📂 Project name display for better context
- 📝 Human-readable session titles instead of cryptic IDs

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Configuration File Location

Create your configuration file at: **`~/.config/ocmonitor/config.toml`**

```bash
# Create the configuration directory
mkdir -p ~/.config/ocmonitor

# Create your configuration file
touch ~/.config/ocmonitor/config.toml
```

### Configuration Options

The tool is highly configurable through the `config.toml` file:

```toml
[paths]
messages_dir = "~/.local/share/opencode/storage/message"
export_dir = "./exports"

[ui]
table_style = "rich"
progress_bars = true
colors = true

[export]
default_format = "csv"
include_metadata = true
```

**Configuration File Search Order:**
1. `~/.config/ocmonitor/config.toml` (recommended user location)
2. `config.toml` (current directory)
3. Project directory fallback
